      <p>I'm Adrian, or you probably recognise me going by the name "SeverelyDamaged" online.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science Student studying at UNSW (I may or may not have had 
        multiple degree changes in the past &#128557;). I'm also currently on the 2023 Exec 
        team for UNSW lo-fi; Society as the Secretary. I also have way too many interests and 
        hobbies &#128517;
